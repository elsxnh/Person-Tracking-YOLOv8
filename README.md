# Person-Tracking-YOLOv8

üìÅ Created by: Elsa Nurul Hidayah, 2023

This repository is created to fulfill the boot camp Computer Vision project requirement from Indonesia AI.

üî¨ This project of person tracking is developed using existing models of YOLOv8 of different sizes from s, l, and xl. Ths usage is simple: to create an artificial intelligence model to track objects for the needs of a futuristic smart city. This system will then automatically detect and track people within a specific point to maintain safety and security within the city.
